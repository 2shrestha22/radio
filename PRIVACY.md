**Radio NP** is an open-source radio streaming app designed to work primarily offline. This privacy policy outlines the data handling and user privacy principles of the app.

## 1. No Data Collection

Radio NP does **not collect**, **store**, or **transmit** any personal data. The app does not require user registration, does not track user activity, and does not access your contacts, location, or device identifiers.
